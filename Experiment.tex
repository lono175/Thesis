\chapter{Experimental Results}

We show the effectiveness of our approach with 
Bus domain and Infinite Mario.
Bus domain is a 6 by 6 grid world problem. 
The number of states for bus domain is
2,304, so it is small enough to apply table-lookup methods to learn
the optimal policy. In this experiment, we combine table-lookup HORDQ and an approximate model-based method 
to illustrate how to increase the learning rate and learn a near-optimal policy with our approach.

For large problems with more than millions of states, it is not possible to adopt
table-lookup methods to learn the optimal policy.
Instead, it is necessary to adopt function approximation techniques to learn the policy.
However, the optimality guarantee of Theorem \ref{thm:opt} relies on table-lookup methods and 
does not hold for function approximation techniques.
With function approximation, it is not possible to learn the optimal policy anymore.
We illustrate our work with Infinite Mario to show that despite the optimality guarantee is lost in
large problems, we can still use model-free methods to help model-based methods handle the effects which
are not included in the model. 
%Since both model-free and model-based methods may not learn the optimal policy, it is possible to 
%combine both methods to learn a better one.

%TODO: why not classical planning?
%TODO: Why it is bad to put too much information to the model?
%TODO: why it is bad to put pit information?

\caption{(a) The Bus domain (b) A task graph for the Bus domain.}
\label{fig:bus}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:bus}(a) shows the bus domain. The bus starts at $S$. Its task
is to pickup all passengers marked as $P$ and return to $S$.
The bus can move North, South, East, or West. There is a reward of -1 applied for each action.
There is 0.1 probability for the bus to move in a random direction. It stays put 
when trying to cross a wall. 
The passengers are picked up automatically when the bus moves into
the location of a passenger. The passengers can be picked up in any order.
The episode ends when it finishes the task.  
There are two possible locations for road construction. They are marked as 
$A$ and $B$. If the bus passes a construction site, it will get damaged with probability 1 and has the probability
of 0.25 to break down for each step afterwards. There is a reward of -50 if the bus breaks down and the episode ends immediately. 
At the beginning of an episode, the status of the road is randomly chosen from no construction, $A$ is under construction,
or $B$ is under construction. There is a 0.05 probability for the road status to change for each step.
The world is divided into six areas. There are six subtasks $Move(1), \dots,$ and $Move(6)$ which move the
bus to the corresponding area.
Subtask $Move(t)$ can only be invoked if $t$ is the adjacent area.
The subtask terminates if the bus exits the current area.
When it terminates, a pseudo-reward $\tilde{r}$ is applied if the bus arrives at designated area $t$ and 0 otherwise.
The task hierarchy is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bus}(b). 

A state can be described by the 8-tuple $(x, y, h, p_1, p_2, p_3, a, b)$, where $(x, y)$ is the location of 
bus, $h$ shows if the bus is damaged, $p_i$ indicates if the corresponding passenger has been picked up or not,
and $a$ and $b$ are binary variables which indicate the status of the construction sites.

%TODO: the damage status is not perceived on the screen, so it cannot be modeled
Since the six subtasks $Move(1), \dots,$ and $Move(6)$ cover all primitive actions, they form a total leaf cover of the hierarchy.
We used HORDQ in the subtasks to guarantee the convergence to the optimal
policy. Subtask $Root$ adopted our approximate model-based method. 

%The planning variables include 
%the location of bus and the status of passengers. The environment variables are the 
%damage status of bus and the status of road. 
%TODO: total leaf cover always exist
%The world is divided by 6 areas. 

\subsection{Planning with static assumptions}
\label{se:Model}

%We adopted model-based approach 

%TODO: dyanmic programming
%TODO: add free + free HORDQ to show that HORDQ makes the hierarchical process useless
The planning variables of our model are $\{x, y, p_1, p_2, p_3\}$, while the damage
status and road conditions are assumed to be static during the planning process.
Our model can learn that a large penalty will be received when the bus is damaged.  
However, our model cannot learn that the bus will get damaged if it passes through
a construction site. The model is certainly biased in this case, thus
it cannot learn the optimal policy. The objective of 
the experiment is to show that the optimal policy can still be learned
if we combine the model-based approach with HORDQ. 

%Based on the results of the previous section, we can safely use any approximate model-based method 
%to learn the Q-values of subtasks which do not belong to $TC(H)$ without worrying
%that it will violate the optimality condition. Model-based RL requires the enumeration of all possible states during the planning process.
%However, it is not feasible when the state space is too large.
%Previous methods (\cite{ApproxDyna, ApproxTree}) rely on function approximation
%techniques to predict the next state. Their model is biased because it is possible 
%to encounter different next states given the same state and policy for a stochastic problem. If we 
%predict one of them, we ignore the stochastic nature of the problem. If we predict
%several, the number of states under consideration may grow exponentially with the number of simulating steps
%and become intractable after a few steps.

%We notice that, for some applications, there are some variables which are more important
%than others. Take the mobile robot navigation problem, for example; the location of the robot 
%is the key to the planning process, while the movement of other objects in the environment is less important.
%Our idea is to separate the variables into planning variables 
%and environment variables. During the planning process, we enumerate all possible values of the planning variables, while assuming 
%the remaining environment variables are static throughout the process. 
%If we limit the number of planning variables to be small, the enumeration process can be efficient.
%It also simplifies the learning of the transition and reward functions, since we only need to learn
%the dynamics and reward models for the planning variables.

Let state $s = (x, y)$, where $x$ consists of planning variables and $y$ consists of environment
variables. Following the MAXQ approach, we decompose the Q-function as:
\begin{equation}
    Q^{\pi}(i, x, j) = Q_r^{\pi}(i, x, j) + Q_c^{\pi}(i, x, j),
    \label{eq:biasedMaxQ}
\end{equation}
where $Q_r^{\pi}(i, x, j)$ is provided by the child subtask $M_j$.

The task of subtask $M_i$ is to compute $Q_c^{\pi}(i, x, j)$ by:
\begin{equation}
    Q_c^{\pi}(i, x, j) = \sum_{x'} P_m^{\pi}(x'|s, j)[Q_r^{\pi}(i, x', \pi_i(x')) + Q_c^{\pi}(i, x', \pi(x'))],
    \label{eq:biasedQc}
\end{equation}

With the formula above, the Q-values can be computed by dynamic programming.

For simplicity, we use the multi-time model \cite{SMDP} to model the transition function: 
\begin{equation}
    P_m(x|s, j) = \sum^{\infty}_{N=1} \gamma^N P(x, N|s, j).
    \label{eq:multiProb}
\end{equation}

$P_m(x|s, j)$ can be estimated by:
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{P}_m(x|s, j) = (1-\alpha)\tilde{P}_m(x|s, j) + \alpha [ \gamma^N \delta_{x'x}],
    \label{eq:approxP}
\end{equation}
for all $x \in S_i$, where $\delta_{x'x}=1$ if $x' = x$ and is 0 otherwise.

with $\epsilon = 0.1$.}
\label{fig:res}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:res}(a) shows the learning curves with different level of pseudo-rewards.
With pseudo-reward +60, it learned a suboptimal policy because
the pseudo-reward is too large to make subtask $Move(t)$ ignore 
the penalty of breakdown. As a result, the subtask followed 
the instruction of its parent too strictly.

On the other hand, if we do not impose any pseudo-reward, 
the optimal policy can be learned, but the learning rate is
slower than SARSA(0) learning. Since the subtask has no
incentive to follow the instruction from the hierarchy, 
the learning process is similar to SARSA(0) learning 
except it has six different Q-functions to learn (one for each subtask) instead of one.
Thus it takes longer to learn the optimal policy. 

With the appropriate pseudo-reward, we can get a near-optimal policy
while the learning rate is faster than SARSA(0)
Our experiment shows that a pseudo-reward of +5 is enough to make the subtask follow 
the order of $Root$ in most of the times, but it is not enough for the subtask to ignore
the breakdown penalty. For example, when $Root$ executes $Move(4)$ to move the bus from area 
3 to area 4 and the road at location $A$ is under construction, $Move(4)$ subtask
will learn it is a bad decision with HORDQ.
Instead of moving to area 4, $Move(4)$ may move to area 1 or 5 to avoid
the breakdown penalty. In turn, $Root$ learns $Move(4)$ cannot be executed in 
such a scenario, thus it will seek an alternate plan if the same scenario
is encountered.

To illustrate the undesirable result when some suboptimal subtasks exist in 
the hierarchy and the MAXQ framework is adopted, we combine our approximate model-based approach
and MAXQ-Q learning in our experiment. The combination learns a suboptimal policy similar to HORDQ with high pseudo-reward. 
Since MAXQ does not estimate the consequence of its action outside its own subtask,
$Move(t)$ will move to area $t$ at any cost. It leads to the frequent damage of the bus.

To simulate the performance of the combination of a poorly-approximated model-based method and 
HORDQ, we replaced our model-based approach with a random policy.
The result is shown in Figure \ref{fig:res}(b). In this case, SARSA(0) has the fastest
learning rate. It takes more time for $Move(t)$ to realize that the policy of $Root$ is bad with higher pseudo rewards.
Nevertheless, it will eventually learn a near-optimal policy.
The combination of random policy and MAXQ has the worst result.

The result shows that a good approximate model 
can help increase the learning rate with the combination of HORDQ. 
If the model is poor, HORDQ serves as a fail-safe mechanism to stop 
the agent repeating the same poor policy over and over again.
On the other hand, MAXQ learned a poor policy in both cases.  
The result suggests that in order to construct a robust HRL 
algorithm, it is beneficial to incorporate HORDQ in the hierarchy.

\section{Infinite Mario}
\label{se:MarioExp}
%reward system here
%and pseudo reward
We use Infinite Mario to show the effectiveness of our approach in large domains. 
Large domains contain more than millions of states, it makes table-lookup methods not applicable
due to the curse of dimensionality. The approximation techniques are required to handle these
problems, but the optimality guarantee will be lost.
%Since model-free methods cannot learn the optimal policy,

It is interesting to see how our work will perform with function approximation techniques,
especially when model-free methods cannot learn the optimal policy.

\subsection{Previous work}
Infinite Mario is an open source Java implementation of Nintendo's Super Mario Brothers game.
It becomes a recent interest in the AI community possibly thanks to
the two AI competitions -- RL 2009 competition and Mario AI competition, which were held in 2009.
The objective of these competitions is to build the best agent that
can play this classic side-scrolling arcade-style game.

The RL 2009 competition requires the competitors to use RL algorithms to build their agents.
On the other hand, the Mario AI 2009 competition \cite{Robin09} 
does not pose any restrictions on the underlying technique.
It encourages
competitors to use neural networks, genetic genetic programming, fuzzy logic, temporal difference learning, and human ingenuity.
The observation 

The observation of Mario AI in RL 2009 competition 
contains the location and speed of Mario and other monsters, as well as
the $22 \times 16$ tiles on the screen.
The agent receives +100 reward when it finishes a level, +1 reward when collects
a coin, and -10 reward when it dies.

%Since this competition focuses on RL algorithms,
%the agent needs to learn the property of environment through interaction.

Mohan and Laird \cite{Mohan09} combine HRL and Soar-RL \cite{Nason05} to build
a Mario agent. In their hierarchy, the task is divided to "Grab Coin", "Search Question", "Tackle Monster",
"Avoid Pit", and "Move to Goal". 
The root subtask chooses one of these subtasks to execute based on the learned
preferences. Each subtask deals with at most one object. For example, 
"Grab Coin" subtask is considered successful only when the specified 
coin is collected. Thus, The number of subtasks available for root task to choose
depends on the current objects in the screen.

Gibson and Risk \cite{Gibson09} adopts the options framework.
The master agent can execute 3 options -- a $SARSA(\lambda)$ agent, a "pit specialist" agent, and a
rule-based agent. The "pit specialist" concerns only the pits, and is available only when
there is a pit within 4 tiles of Mario. 
The master agent uses SMDP Q-learning to learn which option to execute given the state.

Ringstad et al. \cite{Paul09} 
used a modified linear SARSA algorithm to build the agent.
The input features are the locations of 3 nearest monsters or pits.
Their idea is to design an agent that can finish the level as fast as possible.
To encourage the agent to finish the level, they add a pseudo-reward to encourage
the agent to move as far as possible.
They won the Mario AI championship of RL competition 2009.


On the other hand, the Mario AI 2009 competition \cite{Robin09} 
The observation includes $22 \times 22$ tiles on the screen, the location and the speed of monsters, 
and the status of Mario such as "isMarioOnGround" or "mayMarioJump".

%Booleans: mario is on the ground, may
%jump, is carrying a shell, is small/big/fireprovides an interface
The techniques which are adopted by competitors of the Mario AI competition include
$A*$ search, genetic programming, hand-coded policy, a hybrid method of neural network and $A*$ search,
and Cyberneurons.
In general, $A*$ search achieves the best result, and hand-coded policy falls the second.
Robin Baumgarten \cite{Robin09} won the championship of the Mario AI competition in 2009.
His idea is to create a physics engine that can accurately predict the next state of Mario, 
and use $A*$ search to find a path to the right border of the screen as fast as possible.
Since his approach requires the agent to have the complete knowledge of the environment,
the approach falls into the category of classical planning.


Ross et al. \cite{Ross11} use supervised learning to learn the direct policy
mapping between input features and the primitive actions. The input features
are $22 \times 22$ tiles around Mario in previous 4 frames, the state of Mario
and the last 6 actions. The tiles include the types of the ground, blocks, and
monsters.  The state of Mario includes the types (small, big and fire Mario) as well as a
binary feature to indicate if Mario touches the ground or not.
The training data is obtained through search-based methods similar to Baumgarten's work \cite{Robin09}.


The above approaches either depend on game-specific information ("isMarioOnGround")
or depend on the information that is difficult to be retrieved from image features (the location and size of pits).
In this section, we introduce an approach 
to build the agent for Infinite Mario 
without using such information.
We only use the features provided by the simulator of Infinite Mario from RL competition 2009.
%Since these features can be obtained with 
Focusing on image features allow us to generalize our approach to other video games without
the need to redesign features.

%Our goal
%is to train the computer to play this game based on the current
%game image features as input (see Figure 3).

%why RL competion is pure image based
%We do not reguire the agent to have prior knowledge about some special tile patterns which are game-specific

%to allow the agent to simulate its own action in the environment that is identical
%to the game itself. It allows people to use the techniques in classical planning,
%such as search-based methods. 

%Infinite Mario, a Java implementation of Nintendo's Super Mario Bros. game, becomes
%a recent interest in the AI community.
%There is also a recent interest in developing agents that can play a complete side-scrolling
%arcade-style game. In 2009, two AI competitions were organized on agents that can play
%entire levels of Inite Mario, a clone of Nintendo's popular Super Mario Bros game. The
%RL 2009 Competition [Mohan and Laird, 2009] requires the agents to use reinforcement
%learning to learn to play the game. The learning agents are given a state representation
%containing the location of the player character (PC) and other monsters, as well as the types
%of the individual tiles on the screen. The agents receive a positive reward once the level is
%complete, and a small negative reward on all other states. The Mario AI Competition4, on
%the other hand, does not limit the agents to a speci approach. Indeed, the participants
%are encouraged to use evolutionary neural networks, genetic programming, fuzzy logic,
%temporal dirence learning, human ingenuity, [and] hybrids of the above"5. Playing an
%Atari 2600 game was previously attempted by Diuk et. al., who illustrated the performance
%of their Object-Oriented Rmax algorithm by teaching the Player Character to pass the st
%screen of the game Pitfall [Diuk et al., 2008].
%A shared characteristic between all the above examples, and (to our knowledge) all
%previous attempts of learning to play video games, is that each agent is designed and tuned
%to play a single game. Therefore, all the essential game properties (e.g., the location of the
%PC and important NPC's, health levels, and timers) are either explicitly included in the
%state representation, or can be easily extracted form it. Also, game-speci abstractions are
%often performed to deal with the large state-space. Furthermore, the reward signal may be
%shaped in a way to accelerate the learning.
%One of the key distinctions of the methods described in this thesis is their generic nature.

%Screen feature
%assume the location of PC is known
%the result is unknown (the properties of monsters or coins)

\subsection{Infinite Mario domain}

We use the environment of RL competition 2009 to conduct our experiment.
The action space of Infinite Mario consists of 4 buttons which correspond
to the original Nintendo controller.
These buttons are:
\begin{itemize}
%\item Handle the interaction between objects
%\item Not everything can be modeled
\item Direction pad: left or right
\item A button: jump
\item B button: speed
\end{itemize}
Mario can choose to press these buttons or not, so
the number of possible actions are $3 \times 2 \times 2 = 12$ actions.  

To reduce the computation cost of the model-based method, 
we exclude action "speed", "jump speed" and "no op" from the 
action space, since they do not seem to be relevant to the optimal policy.
Thus, Mario can execute one of the 9 actions in our experiment.

The screen of Infinite Mario is comprised of a matrix of $22 \times 16$ tiles.
This matrix is an array of characters, with each element representing the type of tile.
The types of tile are brick, question-block, coin, pipe, empty tile, the finish line and Mario.

Besides the tile information, the information of moving objects are also provided. 
The moving objects are Mario, Red Koopa, Green Koopa, Goomba, Spikey, Piranha Plant, Mushroom, Shell, Fire Flower and Fireball.
The information of each object includes x- and y-positions, x- and y-velocities, and type of object.
Note that the positions and velocities are continuous, so a quantization technique is rquired.

The tile information can be captured from screen with basic image processing techniques \cite{Yavar}.
The location and speed of monsters can be obtained by applying the computer vision techniques such
as object tracking or optical flow.

The levels are generated with 3 parameters: random seed, type, and difficulty.
The difficulty ranges from 0 (easiest) to 9 (hardest). 

The agent will receive the following rewards:
\begin{itemize}
%\item Handle the interaction between objects
%\item Not everything can be modeled
\item +100: finishing a level
\item +1: collecting a coin
\item +1 : hitting a question block
\item +1 : killing a monster
\item -0.01 : step cost
\item -10 : getting killed
\end{itemize}

Besides, we apply a reward equal to the
displacement of x-position to encourage the agent to move as right as possible
and penalize the agent if it moves to left.

%TODO: only 9 actions

\caption{(a) A screenshot of Infinite Mario (b) A planning process conducted by the search-based method.}
\label{fig:Mario}
\end{figure}

%We adopt greedy search in our planning process.
%The planning process begins with a state of Mario. 
%Then it iteratively acquires the next states by applying
%the 9 actions to the state. To avoid fully expand the whole search tree to 
%the depth $K$, which is time-consuming and unnecessary, we expand the state

We adopt the model-based method to learn the transition function of Mario.
The state of Mario 
can be described by a 4-tuple $(x, y, dx, dy)$, where are the location and velocities of Mario. 
The ranges of $x$, $y$, $dx$ and $dy$ are $[0, 318]$, $[0, 15]$, $[-2.5, 2.5]$, and $[-2.5, 2.5]$.
These variable are continuous, so it is not possible to enumerate all possible states
of Mario with dynamic programming techniques. It is possible to discretize the variables, but the resulting state space 
is still too large if we want to predict the dynamics of Mario precisely.

Instead of discretizing the variables, we use regression trees
in Orange package \cite{Orange04} to predict the future position and speed of Mario.
The features are the current speed of Mario and the tiles within 5 by 5 
area around Mario (Fig. \ref{fig:Mario}(a)). There are 27 variables. 
Since each action has different dynamics, 
We build different trees for different actions. 
Given the current state and action, the regression trees should predict 
the speed and position of the following state. 
Following the idea of \cite{Hester09}, we do not directly predict
the next x- and y-position of Mario, but 
the relative changes of positions $\epsilon_x = x' - x$ and 
$\epsilon_y = y' - y$ since modeling relative change may generalize better across states.
However, the relative changes of speeds doesn't generalize well, so we predict
the value of speeds directly (a possible reason is that the maximum speed is capped, so Mario cannot
keep increasing its speed by press the speed button). 
The x-position, y-position, x-speed and y-speed are the class variables for the regression trees.
For simplicity, we separately build regression trees for different class variables. 
In our current implementation, there are 9 actions and 4 class variables, so we 
have 36 regression trees to model the dynamics of Mario. 

We borrowed the idea of Baumgarten \cite{Robin09}--use
the search-based method to find a sequence of actions that moves Mario to the right edge of the screen as fast as possible.
Instead of hard-coded the objective of the search process, we add a possible reward to the agent if it moves
to the right and a negative reward otherwise.
We adopt a simple k-step lookahead greedy search in our planning process.
It begins with the current state of Mario. 
Then it expands one node in the search tree by applying all possible actions. To avoid fully expanding the whole search tree to 
depth $K$, which is time-consuming and unnecessary, we expand the node
with the largest predicted reward. 
The process stops after the number of nodes exceeds 300, then the search algorithm returns 
a sequence of actions which achieves the highest predicted reward.
Since we may not search the tree fully, it is possible for the search algorithm
to return a suboptimal sequence.
To reduce the computation time spent on search, the search algorithm will return
immediately if there is a sequence of action what gets more than +6 reward.

It is crucial for the search-based method to learn when Mario is going to be killed. 
However, the number of samples right before Mario getting killed is limited by the
number of episodes since the episode terminates immediately after the death of Mario.
To efficiently use the available samples, we use a single regression tree to learn the 
reward function. The input features of the regression tree are
the features for the transition function plus the action of the agent. 

The strength of the above method is that it has the terrain knowledge and can move
efficiently to finish a level.
%Another advantage is that it can predict a sequence of actions to jump over a pit.
%The primary difficulty for model-free methods to deal with the pit is that 

%It is quite often that Mario suffers a inevitable death (such as jumps into a monster or falls into a pit).
%If such a scenario happens, there are no actions that can save Mario.
%All action sequences will have a negative predicted reward, so our early return heuristic does not work.

%all possible states of Mario, the planner in our experiment 
%is a $K$-step lookahead greedy search algorithm. The planner searches the states
%which can be reached from the current state within $K$ steps and returns a sequence of
%steps which achieve the highest reward.


%It is crucial for the planning process to learn when Mario is going to be killed. 
%However, the number of samples right before Mario getting killed is limited by the
%number of episodes, which is much smaller than the number of steps. 
%To efficiently use the available samples, we use a single regression tree to learn the 
%reward function.


%To adopt $A^*$ search
%We adopt our static assumption on all objects except Mario. 



%

%TODO: objective: generic AI, challenge here (no specific domain knowledge)
%why model-free approach is necessary

Since we only model the dynamics of Mario, the dynamics of other objects as well as 
the interactions between objects are ignored. 

The effects which are not included in the model:
\begin{itemize}
%\item Handle the interaction between objects
%\item Not everything can be modeled
\item Monsters may appear at the right edge of the screen
\item Monsters disappear at the left edge of the screen
\item Monsters can be killed by Mario
\item Monsters can be killed by falling into a pit
\item Monsters can be killed by a fireball
\item Monsters can be killed by a moving shell
\item Koopma can be turned into a shell
\item Kicking a shell will make it move
\item Jump on top of a moving shell will make it stop
\item Fire Mario can attack with fireballs
\item Small Mario can be turned into Big Mario by eating a mushroom
\item Big Mario can be turned into Fire Mario by eating a fire flower
\end{itemize}

To learn the transition function perfectly, it is necessary to 
learn all the effects correctly. However, learning the effects in a stochastic
problem is NP-Hard \cite{Walsh09} and heuristic solutions are required
to solve it \cite{Pasula07}.

Our work provides an alternative approach to this problem--instead of learning 
all possible effects, we only learn part of them and 
let model-free methods to handle the scenarios where
the effects which are not modeled are relevant to the optimal policy.

\subsection{The model-free method}

Since the model-based method cannot deal with the interaction between objects, we let
model-free method to handle it.

The feature of model-free methods includes the type and location of moving objects
other than Mario it self. To reduce number of features, we do not include the speed of objects.
As noted in \cite{Gibson09}, it is more generalizable if we use "egocentric representation".
That is, we use the relative positions between Mario and objects 
as the features instead of the absolute positions.

Since the number of monsters can be any arbitrary number, 
we cannot use linear SARSA which depends on a fixed feature size.
Instead, we use relational approaches here. 
We incorporate relational temporal difference learning (RTDL) \cite{RRLTD}
with HORDQ. RTDL is a relational extension to linear SARSA, thus it does not
work for continuous variables as well. In our experiment, we simply
round each number to the nearest integer. 

Unlike previous approaches \cite{Paul09, Gibson09, Mohan09, Mohan10},
we do not include the location of pits in our features.
Since the pit is not a moving object nor does it a single tile,
it is not available in the input features of the simulator.
The previous approaches rely on specific codes to parse the tile information
and extract the size and location of a pit. 
We argue that it will destroy the generality of our the method.
Moreover, it is not necessary to include the pit information in model-free methods,
since the pit can be handled by the model-based method. 

\subsection{The hybrid approach}
The state transition function and reward function depend on the policy of 
child subtask, because the child subtask invoked by $root$ may not correspond to the primitive action that is executed by Mario.
It would be more difficult if the effects and the policy are learned at the same time. 
Instead, the transition function is learned from the primitive action that is executed by Mario.

The exploration policy is $\epsilon-$greedy. The epsilon in our experiment is $0.01$.
The exploration policy only applies to the model-free approach. 
The exploration policy in model-free approach is enough to let Mario explore the 
unknown actions. It is not necessary for model-based approach to have the exploration policy as well. 
XX is a special hierarchy. It allows us to combine two different methods under the HRL
framework even for a problem without clear hierarchical structure. 
%no overhead
For this special hierarchy, the pseudo-reward imposes a very interesting property:
the policy is identical to the policy of model-free method with a pseudo-reward equal to zero and
it is identical to the one of model-based method given sufficiently large pseudo-reward.
We can adjust the value of pseudo-reward to alternate the agent's behavior between
two different methods.

%Most of the previous work on RL focus on model-free approaches for several reasons. 
%The most 
%Within a planning agent, there are at least two roles for real experience: it
%can be used to improve the model (to make it more accurately match the real
%environment) and it can be used to directly improve the value function and
%policy using the kinds of reinforcement learning methods we have discussed in
%previous chapters. The former we call model-learning, and the latter we call
%direct reinforcement learning (direct RL). The possible relationships between
%experience, model, values, and policy are summarized in Figure  9.2. Each arrow
%shows a relationship of influence and presumed improvement. Note how experience
%can improve value and policy functions either directly or indirectly via the
%model. It is the latter, which is sometimes called indirect reinforcement
%learning, that is involved in planning. 

%The second branch is model-based RL, which directly estimates
%a model of the environment and then plans with
%this model. Early work demonstrated that summarizing an
%agent’s experience into a model could be an efficient way
%to reuse data (Moore & Atkeson, 1993), and later work utilized
%the uncertainty in an agent’s model to guide exploration,
%yielding the first (probabilistic) finite bounds on the amount of data required
%to learn near-optimal behaviors in the general case (Kearns & Singh, 1998;
%Kakade, 2003).

%1. Assumption on the state difference (if it is not true --> like the agent in a world boundary or the health is 100 and cannot be imporve
  %since the state is outside the known state boundary, the planner whon't plan for it. but the local planner may still direct the agent
  %to go outside the world boundary, which may be a problem)
%2. Application to the hierachical RL
%3. Limitation: unachievable state (a coin surrounded by many monsters)
%4. Can inference in a very small world, not need to do 64 by 64
%Sometimes we need a plan. The greedy approach of reinforcement learning does not always work. 
%RL techniques have several limitations:
%1. It's difficult for to transfer the value function from a small world to a large one. If the agent has
%the experience only in a small world like 4 \times 4 grid, it cannot act well in 64 \times 64 grid
%because it does not know the correct action in regard to an object 63 grid away.

%4. Impossible task to maze problems: RL require that optimal agent to find the optimal solution for a maze when all the features
%are input to the agent. Which is unlikely to work.(impractical when the maze is large)(unable to transfer
%the knowledge from previous maze experience to the current one) A practical solver shall invovle planning through 
%the possible route and find the one which can lead to the exist.
%All the work requires the agent to repeat play the same maze (assuming traps) until it finds the optimal solution.
%What if the maze changes every time?

%1. Is it guarranteed convergence? Yes, if we choose the goal next to the current state which leads to highest Q value. 
%It is the same as SARSA.

%Good to work on the problem with a long term reinforcement (feedback) like a maze.
%Bad to work with a problem with dynamic envirment (everything changes with or without agents actions)

%Stochastic Shortest-Path Problems
%A Stochastic Shortest-Path problem is an mdp prob-
%lem in which the state space S = f1; : : : ; n; tg is such
%that t is a goal (target) state that is absorbing (i.e.,
%p(t; u; t) = 1 and g(t; u) = 0 for all u 2 U(t)), and the
%discount factor ® = 1. In this case, the existence of
%optimal policies (and optimal stationary policies) is a
%major mathematical problem. However, the existence
%is guarantee under the following reasonable conditions:
%(A1) There exists a policy that achieves the goal with
%probability 1 from any starting state.
%(A2) All costs are positive.
%The ¯rst assumption just expresses the fact that the
%problem admits a well-behaved solution. Such policies
%are known as proper policies. The second assumption,
%in the other hand, guarantees that all improper policies
%incurs in in¯nite cost for at least one state. Thus, both
%assumptions preclude cases where the optimal solution
%might \wander" around without never getting to the
%goal. For example, a problem having a zero-cost cycle
%(in state space) violates the second assumption.
%As mentioned in the Introduction, often we are only
%interested in knowing how to go from a ¯xed initial
%state, say 1, to the goal state. The optimal solution in
%this case is an partial optimal stationary policy ¹ such
%that ¹(i) = ¹¤(i) for all states i that are reachable
%from 1 when using the optimal policy ¹¤; the so-called
%relevant states when starting from 1.1
%Finding a partial optimal policy can be consider-
%ably simpler, the extreme case when the set of relevant
%states is ¯nite and the complete state space is in¯nite.
%Thus, the question of how to ¯nd partial optimal poli-
%cies is of great relevance. One algorithm for that is
%Real-Time Dynamic Programming.

%There are two ways for a RL agent to use its sample data. It can use the sample data to update the 
%value function and improve its policy. It is called model-free (or direct) reinforcement learning. 
%Another approach is to use the sample data to estimate parameters for the model of the environment and compute the value function
%from the model. It is called model-based (indirect) reinforcement learning.

%The advantage of model-based approaches is that they make more efficient use of the sample data, thus 
%it take fewer time to train a model-based RL agent. Other the other hand, model-free approaches do not assume 
%a prior model, so it would not be affected by the bias of the model design. Besides, the existence of 
%good linear approximation algorithms, such as linear SARSA, makes it possible for model-free approaches to
%handle large scale problems.

%Model-based approaches needs to enumerate through all possible states to compute the value function. 
%But the number of states grows exponentially with the number of features, 
%and it quickly becomes intractable if the number features grows large.

%The main idea of this work is to combine the model-free, model-based and hierarchical reinforcement learning.
%For the lower level of hierarchy, we adopt the model-free approach to handle the complete and possibly large state space.
%On the top level of hierarchy, we use the model-based to plan on a coarser level, which contains only small number of states.
%This approach allows the agent to plan on the higher level and make efficient use of the sample data. On the lower level,
%the agent uses model-free approaches with linear approximation to handle the complete state space.

%The prior works on hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) can be divided into two categories: model-free and model-based approaches. 
%The model-free approaches include HAMQ \cite{HAMQ}, MAXQ \cite{MAXQ}, SMDP and options framework \cite{option}
%For model-based approaches, Seri et al. \cite{HLearning} proposed a model-based HRL in average reward setting.
%Diuk et al. \cite{Diuk} adopted model-based HRL to deterministic domain. Jong and Stone \cite{RMaxQ} combined 
%R-MAXQ and MAXQ to achieve efficient model-based exploration and the action abstraction of MAXQ.

%TODO: show that model based state difference can learn randomly generated maze with very limited steps (only four touches of the wall)
%TODO: use a poison example to show the limit of pure approximated model-based approach and the motivation
%of use hierarchical optimal policy for pseudo reward and recursive optimal policy for real reward. It can be shown that
%it will converge to optimal policy if the true goal state of the game is included as a subgoal(
%the worst case is the child node finish the game by itself)
