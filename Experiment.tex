\chapter{Experimental Results}

We show the effectiveness of our approach with 
Bus domain and Super Mario Bros. 
Bus domain is a 6 by 6 grid world problem. 
The number of states for bus domain is
2,304, so it is small enough to apply the table lookup Q-learning to learn
the optimal policy. In this experiment, we combine table lookup HORDQ and an approximate model-based method 
to illustrate how to increase the learning rate and learn a near-optimal policy with our approach.

Bus domain is a kind of toy problem with few thousand states and can be handled by table lookup
Q-learning. For large problems with more than millions of states, it is not possible to adopt
table lookup methods to learn the optimal policy.
Instead, it is necessary to adopt function approximation techniques to learn the policy.
With function approximation, it is not possible to learn the optimal policy anymore.
However, the optimality guarantee of Theorem \ref{thm:opt} relies on table lookup methods and 
does not hold for function approximation techniques.
We iilustrate our work with Super Mario Bros. to show that despite the optimality guarantee is lost in
large problems, we can still use model-free methods to help model-based methods handle.the effects which
are not included in the model. 
Since both model-free and model-based methods may not learn the optimal policy, it is possible to 
combine both methods to learn a better one.


%For large problems, both model-based and model-free methods may learn a suboptimal policy. 


%On the other hand, the state space of Super Mario Bros. is too large to adopt table lookup
%methods. 
%However, the learned policy of Q-learning with function approximation might not be optimal.

\caption{(a) The bus domain (b) A task graph for the bus domain.}
\label{fig:bus}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:bus}(a) shows the bus domain. The bus starts at $S$. Its task 
is to pickup all passengers marked as $P$ and return to the .
The bus can move North, South, East, or West. There is a reward of -1 applied for each action.
There is 0.1 probability for the bus to move in a random direction. It stays put 
when trying to cross a wall. 
The passengers are picked up automatically when the bus moves into
the location of a passenger. The passengers can be picked up in any order.
The episode ends when it finishes the task.  
There are two possible locations for road construction. They are marked as 
$A$ and $B$. If the bus passes a construction site, it will get damaged with probability 1 and has the probability
of 0.25 to break down for each step afterwards. There is a reward of -50 if the bus breaks down and the episode ends immediately. 
At the beginning of an episode, the status of the road is randomly chosen from no construction, $A$ is under construction,
or $B$ is under construction. There is a 0.05 probability for the road status to change for each step.
The world is divided into six areas. There are six subtasks $Move(1), \dots,$ and $Move(6)$ which move the
bus to the corresponding area.
Subtask $Move(t)$ can only be invoked if $t$ is the adjacent area.
The subtask terminates if the bus exits the current area.
When it terminates, a pseudo-reward $\tilde{r}$ is applied if the bus arrives at designated area $t$ and 0 otherwise.
The task hierarchy is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bus}(b). 

A state can be described by the 8-tuple $(x, y, h, p_1, p_2, p_3, a, b)$, where $(x, y)$ is the location of 
bus, $h$ shows if the bus is damaged, $p_i$ indicates if the corresponding passenger has been picked up or not,
and $a$ and $b$ are binary variables which indicate the status of the construction sites.

%TODO: the damage status is not perceived on the screen, so it cannot be modeled
Since the six subtasks $Move(1), \dots,$ and $Move(6)$ cover all primitive actions, they form a total leaf cover of the hierarchy.
We used HORDQ in the subtasks to guarantee the convergence to the optimal
policy. Subtask $Root$ adopted our approximate model-based method. 

%The planning variables include 
%the location of bus and the status of passengers. The environment variables are the 
%damage status of bus and the status of road. 
%TODO: total leaf cover always exist
%The world is divided by 6 areas. 

\section{Planning with Static Assumptions}
\label{se:Model}

We adopted model-based approach 

%TODO: dyanmic programming
The planning variables of our model are $\{x, y, p_1, p_2, p_3\}$, while the damage
status and road conditions are assumed to be static during the planning process.
Our model can learn that a large penalty will be received when the bus is damaged.  
However, our model cannot learn that the bus will get damaged if it passes through
a construction site. The model is certainly biased in this case, thus
it cannot learn the optimal policy. The objective of 
the experiment is to show that the optimal policy can still be learned
if we combine the model-based approach with HORDQ. 

%Based on the results of the previous section, we can safely use any approximate model-based method 
%to learn the Q-values of subtasks which do not belong to $TC(H)$ without worrying
%that it will violate the optimality condition. Model-based RL requires the enumeration of all possible states during the planning process.
%However, it is not feasible when the state space is too large.
%Previous methods (\cite{ApproxDyna, ApproxTree}) rely on function approximation
%techniques to predict the next state. Their model is biased because it is possible 
%to encounter different next states given the same state and policy for a stochastic problem. If we 
%predict one of them, we ignore the stochastic nature of the problem. If we predict
%several, the number of states under consideration may grow exponentially with the number of simulating steps
%and become intractable after a few steps.

%We notice that, for some applications, there are some variables which are more important
%than others. Take the mobile robot navigation problem, for example; the location of the robot 
%is the key to the planning process, while the movement of other objects in the environment is less important.
%Our idea is to separate the variables into planning variables 
%and environment variables. During the planning process, we enumerate all possible values of the planning variables, while assuming 
%the remaining environment variables are static throughout the process. 
%If we limit the number of planning variables to be small, the enumeration process can be efficient.
%It also simplifies the learning of the transition and reward functions, since we only need to learn
%the dynamics and reward models for the planning variables.

Let state $s = (x, y)$, where $x$ consists of planning variables and $y$ consists of environment
variables. Following the MAXQ approach, we decompose the Q-function as:
\begin{equation}
    Q^{\pi}(i, x, j) = Q_r^{\pi}(i, x, j) + Q_c^{\pi}(i, x, j),
    \label{eq:biasedMaxQ}
\end{equation}
where $Q_r^{\pi}(i, x, j)$ is provided by the child subtask $M_j$.

The task of subtask $M_i$ is to compute $Q_c^{\pi}(i, x, j)$ by:
\begin{equation}
    Q_c^{\pi}(i, x, j) = \sum_{x'} P_m^{\pi}(x'|s, j)[Q_r^{\pi}(i, x', \pi_i(x')) + Q_c^{\pi}(i, x', \pi(x'))],
    \label{eq:biasedQc}
\end{equation}

With the formula above, the Q-values can be computed by dynamic programming.

For simplicity, we use the multi-time model \cite{SMDP} to model the transition function: 
\begin{equation}
    P_m(x|s, j) = \sum^{\infty}_{N=1} \gamma^N P(x, N|s, j).
    \label{eq:multiProb}
\end{equation}

$P_m(x|s, j)$ can be estimated by:
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{P}_m(x|s, j) = (1-\alpha)\tilde{P}_m(x|s, j) + \alpha [ \gamma^N \delta_{x'x}],
    \label{eq:approxP}
\end{equation}
for all $x \in S_i$, where $\delta_{x'x}=1$ if $x' = x$ and is 0 otherwise.

with $\epsilon = 0.1$.}
\label{fig:res}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:res}(a) shows the learning curves with different level of pseudo-rewards.
With pseudo-reward +60, it learned a suboptimal policy because
the pseudo-reward is too large to make subtask $Move(t)$ ignore 
the penalty of breakdown. As a result, the subtask followed 
the instruction of its parent too strictly.

On the other hand, if we do not impose any pseudo-reward, 
the optimal policy can be learned, but the learning rate is
slower than SARSA(0) learning. Since the subtask has no
incentive to follow the instruction from the hierarchy, 
the learning process is similar to SARSA(0) learning 
except it has six different Q-functions to learn (one for each subtask) instead of one.
Thus it takes longer to learn the optimal policy. 

With the appropriate pseudo-reward, we can get a near-optimal policy
while the learning rate is faster than SARSA(0)
Our experiment shows that a pseudo-reward of +5 is enough to make the subtask follow 
the order of $Root$ in most of the times, but it is not enough for the subtask to ignore
the breakdown penalty. For example, when $Root$ executes $Move(4)$ to move the bus from area 
3 to area 4 and the road at location $A$ is under construction, $Move(4)$ subtask
will learn it is a bad decision with HORDQ.
Instead of moving to area 4, $Move(4)$ may move to area 1 or 5 to avoid
the breakdown penalty. In turn, $Root$ learns $Move(4)$ cannot be executed in 
such a scenario, thus it will seek an alternate plan if the same scenario
is encountered.

To illustrate the undesirable result when some suboptimal subtasks exist in 
the hierarchy and the MAXQ framework is adopted, we combine our approximate model-based approach
and MAXQ-Q learning in our experiment. The combination learns a suboptimal policy similar to HORDQ with high pseudo-reward. 
Since MAXQ does not estimate the consequence of its action outside its own subtask,
$Move(t)$ will move to area $t$ at any cost. It leads to the frequent damage of the bus.

To simulate the performance of the combination of a poorly-approximated model-based method and 
HORDQ, we replaced our model-based approach with a random policy.
The result is shown in Figure \ref{fig:res}(b). In this case, SARSA(0) has the fastest
learning rate. It takes more time for $Move(t)$ to realize that the policy of $Root$ is bad with higher pseudo rewards.
Nevertheless, it will eventually learn a near-optimal policy.
The combination of random policy and MAXQ has the worst result.

The result shows that a good approximate model 
can help increase the learning rate with the combination of HORDQ. 
If the model is poor, HORDQ serves as a fail-safe mechanism to stop 
the agent repeating the same poor policy over and over again.
On the other hand, MAXQ learned a poor policy in both cases.  
The result suggests that in order to construct a robust HRL 
algorithm, it is beneficial to incorporate HORDQ in the hierarchy.

%On the contrary, the combination of MAXQ and a poor approximated model has
%a performance similar to random policy.

\section{Super Mario Brothers}

%reward system here
%and pseudo reward
\subsection{Planner}
We adopt our static assumption on all objects except Mario. The state of Mario 
can be described by a 4-tuple $(x, y, dx, dy)$, where are the location and speed of Mario. 
The ranges of $x$, $y$, $dx$ and $dy$ are $[0, 21]$, $[0, 15]$, $[-2, 2]$, and $[-2, 2]$.
These variable are continuous, so it is not possible to enumerate all possible states
of Mario. It is possible to discretize the variables, but the resulting state space 
is still too large if we want to predict the dynamics of Mario in fine detail.
It makes it impossible to adapt the dynamic programming technique to Super Mario Bros.

The exploration policy is $\epsilon-$greedy. The epsilon in our experiment is $0.01$.
The exploration policy only applies to the model-free approach. 
The exploration policy in model-free approach is enough to let Mario explore the 
unknown actions. It is not necessary for model-based approach to have the exploration policy as well. 

Instead of enumerating all possible states of Mario, the planner in our experiment 
is a $K$-step lookahead greedy search algorithm. The planner searches the states
which can be reached from the current state within $K$ steps and returns a sequence of
steps which achieve the highest reward.

%why model-free approach is necessary
Since we only model the dynamics of Mario, the dynamics of other objects as well as 
the interactions between objects are ignored. 

The effects are listed below:
\begin{itemize}
%\item Handle the interaction between objects
%\item Not everything can be modeled
\item Monster can be killed
\item Turtle -> shell
\item Kick the shell may kill monsters
\item Kick the shell may kill Mario
\item Monsters come out from the right edge of the screen
\item Fiery Mario can attack with fireballs
\item Fireball kills the monster
\end{itemize}

To learn the transition function perfectly, it is necessary to 
learn all the effects correct in Super Mario Bros. 
XX approach handles the problem by assuming all pre-conditions and post-conditions are known,
and learns the probability for the effects. XX proposes a heuristic search 
to search for possible effects.
However,
learning the effects is a NP-Hard problem in general (TODO: cite here). 

Our work provides an alternative approach to this problem--instead of learning 
all possible effects in the problem domain, we only learn part of them and 
let model-free approaches to handle the scenarios which cannot be 
described by the model.

%The heuristic to reduce the search time
%TODO: up to 6 tiles away
%TODO: no jump involved when it is not going to move up (list all primitive actions, and why they greatly reduce the search space)
%TODO: stop search when is the reward to too negative

%details
%model-based approach knows both tile info and monster info
In our experiment, we do not assume the planner has the prior knowledge about 
the dynamics of Super Mario Bros. To learn the dynamics of Mario, we use regression trees
to predict the future position and speed of Mario. 
The features are represented by the speed of Mario and the tiles within 5 by 5 
area around Mario. There are 27 variables. 
Since each action has different dynamics, 
We build different trees for different actions. 
Given the current state and action, the regression trees should predict 
the x-speed and y-speed of the following state. It is possible to predict
the next x-position and y-position of Mario, but 
it can be more generalizable if we predict difference of the positions $\epsilon_x = x' - x$ and 
$\epsilon_y = y' - y$. The 4 variables are the class variables for the regression trees.
For simplicity, we separately build regression trees for different class variables. 
In our current implementation, there are 9 actions and 4 class variables, so we 
have 36 regression trees to model the dynamics of Mario. 

It is crucial for the planning process to learn when Mario is going to be killed. 
However, the number of samples right before Mario getting killed is limited by the
number of episodes, which is much smaller than the number of steps. 
To efficiently use the available samples, we use a single regression tree to learn the 
reward function.

The state transition function and reward function depend on the policy of 
child subtask, because the child subtask invoked by $root$ may not correspond to the primitive action that is executed by Mario.
It would be more difficult if the effects and the policy are learned at the same time. 
Instead, the transition function is learned from the primitive action that is executed by Mario.

%lookahead planning
%input new area of 2 x 2
We adopt greedy search in our planning process.
The planning process begins with a state of Mario. 
Then it iteratively acquires the next states by applying
the 9 actions to the state. To avoid fully expand the whole search tree to 
the depth $K$, which is time-consuming and unnecessary, we expand the state
with the largest predicted reward. 
The process stops after we acquire $M$ nodes, then the planner returns 
a sequence of actions which achieves the highest predicted reward.
Since we may not search the tree fully, it is possible to have

it is possible to use K-step lookahead to find an path from beginning
to the end (TODO: Mario Competition here). We do

%Most of the previous work on RL focus on model-free approaches for several reasons. 
%The most 
%Within a planning agent, there are at least two roles for real experience: it
%can be used to improve the model (to make it more accurately match the real
%environment) and it can be used to directly improve the value function and
%policy using the kinds of reinforcement learning methods we have discussed in
%previous chapters. The former we call model-learning, and the latter we call
%direct reinforcement learning (direct RL). The possible relationships between
%experience, model, values, and policy are summarized in Figure  9.2. Each arrow
%shows a relationship of influence and presumed improvement. Note how experience
%can improve value and policy functions either directly or indirectly via the
%model. It is the latter, which is sometimes called indirect reinforcement
%learning, that is involved in planning. 

%The second branch is model-based RL, which directly estimates
%a model of the environment and then plans with
%this model. Early work demonstrated that summarizing an
%agent’s experience into a model could be an efficient way
%to reuse data (Moore & Atkeson, 1993), and later work utilized
%the uncertainty in an agent’s model to guide exploration,
%yielding the first (probabilistic) finite bounds on the amount of data required
%to learn near-optimal behaviors in the general case (Kearns & Singh, 1998;
%Kakade, 2003).

%Stochastic Shortest-Path Problems
%A Stochastic Shortest-Path problem is an mdp prob-
%lem in which the state space S = f1; : : : ; n; tg is such
%that t is a goal (target) state that is absorbing (i.e.,
%p(t; u; t) = 1 and g(t; u) = 0 for all u 2 U(t)), and the
%discount factor ® = 1. In this case, the existence of
%optimal policies (and optimal stationary policies) is a
%major mathematical problem. However, the existence
%is guarantee under the following reasonable conditions:
%(A1) There exists a policy that achieves the goal with
%probability 1 from any starting state.
%(A2) All costs are positive.
%The ¯rst assumption just expresses the fact that the
%problem admits a well-behaved solution. Such policies
%are known as proper policies. The second assumption,
%in the other hand, guarantees that all improper policies
%incurs in in¯nite cost for at least one state. Thus, both
%assumptions preclude cases where the optimal solution
%might \wander" around without never getting to the
%goal. For example, a problem having a zero-cost cycle
%(in state space) violates the second assumption.
%As mentioned in the Introduction, often we are only
%interested in knowing how to go from a ¯xed initial
%state, say 1, to the goal state. The optimal solution in
%this case is an partial optimal stationary policy ¹ such
%that ¹(i) = ¹¤(i) for all states i that are reachable
%from 1 when using the optimal policy ¹¤; the so-called
%relevant states when starting from 1.1
%Finding a partial optimal policy can be consider-
%ably simpler, the extreme case when the set of relevant
%states is ¯nite and the complete state space is in¯nite.
%Thus, the question of how to ¯nd partial optimal poli-
%cies is of great relevance. One algorithm for that is
%Real-Time Dynamic Programming.

%There are two ways for a RL agent to use its sample data. It can use the sample data to update the 
%value function and improve its policy. It is called model-free (or direct) reinforcement learning. 
%Another approach is to use the sample data to estimate parameters for the model of the environment and compute the value function
%from the model. It is called model-based (indirect) reinforcement learning.

%The advantage of model-based approaches is that they make more efficient use of the sample data, thus 
%it take fewer time to train a model-based RL agent. Other the other hand, model-free approaches do not assume 
%a prior model, so it would not be affected by the bias of the model design. Besides, the existence of 
%good linear approximation algorithms, such as linear SARSA, makes it possible for model-free approaches to
%handle large scale problems.

%Model-based approaches needs to enumerate through all possible states to compute the value function. 
%But the number of states grows exponentially with the number of features, 
%and it quickly becomes intractable if the number features grows large.

%The main idea of this work is to combine the model-free, model-based and hierarchical reinforcement learning.
%For the lower level of hierarchy, we adopt the model-free approach to handle the complete and possibly large state space.
%On the top level of hierarchy, we use the model-based to plan on a coarser level, which contains only small number of states.
%This approach allows the agent to plan on the higher level and make efficient use of the sample data. On the lower level,
%the agent uses model-free approaches with linear approximation to handle the complete state space.

%The prior works on hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) can be divided into two categories: model-free and model-based approaches. 
%The model-free approaches include HAMQ \cite{HAMQ}, MAXQ \cite{MAXQ}, SMDP and options framework \cite{option}
%For model-based approaches, Seri et al. \cite{HLearning} proposed a model-based HRL in average reward setting.
%Diuk et al. \cite{Diuk} adopted model-based HRL to deterministic domain. Jong and Stone \cite{RMaxQ} combined 
%R-MAXQ and MAXQ to achieve efficient model-based exploration and the action abstraction of MAXQ.

%TODO: show that model based state difference can learn randomly generated maze with very limited steps (only four touches of the wall)
%TODO: use a poison example to show the limit of pure approximated model-based approach and the motivation
%of use hierarchical optimal policy for pseudo reward and recursive optimal policy for real reward. It can be shown that
%it will converge to optimal policy if the true goal state of the game is included as a subgoal(
%the worst case is the child node finish the game by itself)
