\chapter{Abstract}

We introduce a new relational template selection approach as 
an effective approach to solve relational Markov decision problems
with large state spaces. Our algorithm uses L1-regularized regression
to select and learn a set of local functions defined over relational templates
and we approximate the value function as the linear combination of these local
functions. We present experiments using avoid-predator-and-eatfood problem and Atari 2600 games.
The result shows that our approach achieves higher learning rate than non-relational methods.
