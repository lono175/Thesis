\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I am very fortunate to have had the opportunity to study and do research at
the University of British Columbia. I am most grateful to my supervisor, Alan Mackworth.
When I proposed the idea of developing a generic game AI for video games, he
accepted and allowed me to work on a problem which I am really passionate about.
Besides, I would like to thank David Buchman, John Chia and Bruno Norberto da Silva
for sharing their knowledge and expertise in reinforcement learning.
%Without his encouragement and kindness, I would have gave up this idea long before.
I would also like to thank Tzu-Kuo Huang for sharing
the new research works done at CMU. One of the works actually inspired
the idea of this thesis.
A special thank goes to Prof. Poole, who gave me many precious ideas to make this
thesis better.
And most importantly, I would like to thank my parents, who support
me whenever I need it. Without them, it would have been impossible to finish this work.
%Thank those people who helped you. 

%Don't forget your parents or loved ones.

%You may wish to acknowledge your funding sources.

%I have been very fortunate to have an enjoyable and fruitful learning experience here in
%University of Alberta, and for this I am most grateful to my supervisor, Michael Bowling.
%He has provided me with the opportunity to work on a research topic that I am truly
%passionate about, given me enough academic freedom to experiment and learn on my own,
%and yet he has always been there to guide me when I was lost and confused.
%I am very thankful to my fellow graduate students who have generously and patiently
%shared their knowledge and expertise and have been instrumental for the completion of this
%thesis. In particular, I would like to thank Marc Lanctot and Chris Rayner for sharing their
%knowledge and getting me started with the Atari 2600 hardware and the emulation tools,
%Mohammad Shaei for sharing his insights on the concepts behind the UCT algorithm,
%and Michael Johanson for oering his expertise on running batch simulations on computer
%clusters. Our late night discussions with Amir-Massoud Farahmand have been some of the
%best learning experiences I have had through the last two years. I am very grateful to him,
%who has been both an inspiring colleague and a good friend.
%I am indebted to the team behind Stella, the Atari 2600 emulator, for releasing their
%work as open-source and allowing me to build my toolset on top of their code. I would
%also like to thank Richard Sutton and the RLAI group for releasing the source code of their
%Tile-Coding and Sarsa() implementations. I hope that releasing my own code base as
%open-source will be similarly benecial to other researchers and hobbyists.

%I would like to thank my supervisor, Michiel van de Panne, for his continuous
%support, guidance, and his willingness to let me explore the research tangents
%that made my time here so enjoyable. Michiel's joyful excitement about the
%eld is infectious, and I will cherish the times we spent reverse-engineering
%the human and animal motor system. The insights I gained through our
%discussions about academia have been particularly helpful and shaped me
%as a researcher.
%I am also thankful to Nando de Freitas for contributing ideas to this project,
%and for helping me with this thesis. I had the opportunity to closely interact
%with Nando on many projects and endeavors over the last two years, and
%his support, excitement, and can-do attitude have been very helpful and
%inspiring.
%I would also like to extend my thanks to David Lowe, Bob Woodham, and
%Kevin Murphy, all of whom I've come to know and admire over the last two
%years. I also had the pleasure of working with Steve Wolfman and Kimberly
%Voll as a TA on several occasions, and I am thankful to have witnessed their
%inspiring dedication to teaching.
%My thanks go to my bullpen mates and lab mates Paul Vanetti, John Chia,
%Byron Knoll, Stelian Coros, Philippe Beaudoin, Ben Jones, and many others
%who I don't have enough space to name for contributing to a pleasant, fun
%working atmosphere and oering healthy distractions from work.
%I wish to thank my sister for her unconditional support, and my parents,
%who sacriced to bring us to Canada and made it possible for me to pursue
%my dreams.
%Last but not least, I wish to thank Shelly, for giving me something to look
%forward to every day.

%I thank my advisor Alan Mackworth for being extremely supportive, friendly and
%amazingly open to very different research ideas. It is incredible how you manage to
%keep me on track without restricting the paths I choose to follow. Your generosity
%and helpfulness are a great lesson that I hope I can replicate one day with my own
%students. You are an idol.
%I’m grateful for all my LCI colleagues, for the stimulating environment and
%support. I learned a lot from many of you. A special note goes to Prof Giuseppe
%Carenini who helped me with my PhD application and 
%All my family in Brazil, for all the emails, phone calls, thoughts. Thanks for
%all your patience, care, support. And I’m trying hard to find the time to go back
%and see you all again.
%ma femme. Nao sei se devo repetir os votos ou se
%referencio minhas teses de graduacao e mestrado. Em todo caso, Helena fica aqui
%registrada como a motivacao e inspiracao deste e de todo meu trabalho.
