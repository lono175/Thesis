\chapter{Planning}
There are two ways for a RL agent to use its sample data. It can use the sample data to update the 
value function and improve its policy. It is called model-free (or direct) reinforcement learning. 
Another approach is to use the sample data to estimate parameters for the model of the environment and compute the value function
from the model. It is called model-based (indirect) reinforcement learning.

The advantage of model-based approaches is that they make more efficient use of the sample data, thus 
it take fewer time to train a model-based RL agent. Other the other hand, model-free approaches do not assume 
a prior model, so it would not be affected by the bias of the model design. Besides, the existence of 
good linear approximation algorithms, such as linear SARSA, makes it possible for model-free approaches to
handle large scale problems.

Model-based approaches needs to enumerate through all possible states to compute the value function. 
But the number of states grows exponentially with the number of features, 
and it quickly becomes intractable if the number features grows large.

The main idea of this work is to combine the model-free, model-based and hierarchical reinforcement learning.
For the lower level of hierarchy, we adopt the model-free approach to handle the complete and possibly large state space.
On the top level of hierarchy, we use the model-based to plan on a coarser level, which contains only small number of states.
This approach allows the agent to plan on the higher level and make efficient use of the sample data. On the lower level,
the agent uses model-free approaches with linear approximation to handle the complete state space.

The prior works on hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) can be divided into two categories: model-free and model-based approaches. 
The model-free approaches include HAMQ \cite{HAMQ}, MAXQ \cite{MAXQ}, SMDP and options framework \cite{option}
For model-based approaches, Seri et al. \cite{HLearning} proposed a model-based HRL in average reward setting.
Diuk et al. \cite{Diuk} adopted model-based HRL to deterministic domain. Jong and Stone \cite{RMaxQ} combined 
R-MAXQ and MAXQ to achieve efficient model-based exploration and the action abstraction of MAXQ.

%Take the eat-food-and-avoid-monster game in Fig. \ref{fig:monster_plan} as the motivating example. 
%The top level planner finds a path to the location of coins. 
%The low level deals with primitive actions to go the the destination specified by the top level planner.
%If the monsters do not move and the actions are deterministic
%, the optimal policy of the game can be founded by the shortest path algorithm. The goal state is the location of the food,
%the cost to move to the adjacent location is $1$, if there is a monster in the adjacent location, the cost 
%to move to it is $\infty$. The agent only needs to compute the lowest cost path from its current position to the goal,
%and choose the action which can keep it on this precomputed path.

%However, the game is not a static one. The monsters may move around and block the precomputed path. The actions of
%agent may have unpredictable result to lead it out of the precomputed path.
%This stochastic natural of the game makes it natural to formulate the problem as a stochastic shortest path
%problem. A stochastic shortest-path (SSP) problem is a MDP problem with a absorbing goal state and positive costs.
%A solution of a SSP problem is a policy from the initial state to the goal state with minimum expected cost.

%Most of the previous work on RL focus on model-free approaches for several reasons. 
%The most 
%Within a planning agent, there are at least two roles for real experience: it
%can be used to improve the model (to make it more accurately match the real
%environment) and it can be used to directly improve the value function and
%policy using the kinds of reinforcement learning methods we have discussed in
%previous chapters. The former we call model-learning, and the latter we call
%direct reinforcement learning (direct RL). The possible relationships between
%experience, model, values, and policy are summarized in Figure  9.2. Each arrow
%shows a relationship of influence and presumed improvement. Note how experience
%can improve value and policy functions either directly or indirectly via the
%model. It is the latter, which is sometimes called indirect reinforcement
%learning, that is involved in planning. 

%The second branch is model-based RL, which directly estimates
%a model of the environment and then plans with
%this model. Early work demonstrated that summarizing an
%agent’s experience into a model could be an efficient way
%to reuse data (Moore & Atkeson, 1993), and later work utilized
%the uncertainty in an agent’s model to guide exploration,
%yielding the first (probabilistic) finite bounds on the amount of data required
%to learn near-optimal behaviors in the general case (Kearns & Singh, 1998;
%Kakade, 2003).


%motivation: play a randomly generate maze to adapt to

%weakness-> an adversary to block the path forever
%no knowledge (coin won't disappear-->need hack to do it, moster won't move)
%comparison to the previous work->HRL,


%model based-> state space is too large. good to train with
%few examples (10 sec training)
%model free-> cannot handle randomly generated maze -> failed to adapt to noval situation. can handle large space (linear SARSA)

%combine both-> use model based on top level to reduce
%the state space, and model free on bottom to

%1. Assumption on the state difference (if it is not true --> like the agent in a world boundary or the health is 100 and cannot be imporve
  %since the state is outside the known state boundary, the planner whon't plan for it. but the local planner may still direct the agent
  %to go outside the world boundary, which may be a problem)
%2. Application to the hierachical RL
%3. Limitation: unachievable state (a coin surrounded by many monsters)
%4. Can inference in a very small world, not need to do 64 by 64
%Sometimes we need a plan. The greedy approach of reinforcement learning does not always work. 
%RL techniques have several limitations:
%1. It's difficult for to transfer the value function from a small world to a large one. If the agent has
%the experience only in a small world like 4 \times 4 grid, it cannot act well in 64 \times 64 grid
%because it does not know the correct action in regard to an object 63 grid away.

%2. It takes a long time to train the agent to be good enough. The greedy 

%3. The approximation only good in a small range. We need a plan for long term action.
%The noval state (the state in current game which has not been experienced) may 

%4. Impossible task to maze problems: RL require that optimal agent to find the optimal solution for a maze when all the features
%are input to the agent. Which is unlikely to work.(impractical when the maze is large)(unable to transfer
%the knowledge from previous maze experience to the current one) A practical solver shall invovle planning through 
%the possible route and find the one which can lead to the exist.
%All the work requires the agent to repeat play the same maze (assuming traps) until it finds the optimal solution.
%What if the maze changes every time?

%1. Is it guarranteed convergence? Yes, if we choose the goal next to the current state which leads to highest Q value. 
%It is the same as SARSA.
%2. How to choose the goal to guarrante convergence to optimal policy?

%Good to work on the problem with a long term reinforcement (feedback) like a maze.
%Bad to work with a problem with dynamic envirment (everything changes with or without agents actions)
%Bad when the consequence of an action is delayed for many steps. (poison)

%Consider the eat-food-and-avoid-monster game in Fig. \ref{fig:monster_plan}. If the monsters do not move and the actions are deterministic
%, the optimal policy of the game can be founded by the shortest path algorithm. The goal state is the location of the food,
%the cost to move to the adjacent location is $1$, if there is a monster in the adjacent location, the cost 
%to move to it is $\infty$. The agent only needs to compute the lowest cost path from its current position to the goal,
%and choose the action which can keep it on this precomputed path.

%However, the game is not a static one. The monsters may move around and block the precomputed path. The actions of
%agent may have unpredictable result to lead it out of the precomputed path.
%This stochastic natural of the game makes it natural to formulate the problem as a stochastic shortest path
%problem. A stochastic shortest-path (SSP) problem is a MDP problem with a absorbing goal state and positive costs.
%A solution of a SSP problem is a policy from the initial state to the goal state with minimum expected cost.

%A work by Zucker et al. \cite{Planner} introduced a two-level approach to solve a maze problem.
%The planner uses the shortest path algorithm to find a path from the current state to the goal state.
%The cost of each step is estimated by Q value, which is computed by the SARSA algorithm.

%A issue occurred when we want to apply this approach to general MDP problems: we do not know the 
%goal state. The objective of MDP is to find a sequence of actions which can maximize the overall 
%rewards. There are no clearly defined "goal" for the MDP problems.

%A possible way to adopt the planning technique to the MDP problems is to choose a sequence 
%of goals which can maximize the overall rewards. The goal can be chosen to be the state
%with the highest expected reward. To achieve this, an agent needs to learn 
%the probability to move from one state to another, and the reward to be received
%from each state. 

%The approach is two fold. In the beginning, the planner selects a path from the current 
%state to the goal state with the highest expected reward. The path consists of several
%nodes, which are considered as the subgoals of the plan. The RL agent finds the subgoal 
%right after the current state, and chooses a sequence of actions which can lead the agent
%to the subgoal. The result can be either success or failure, and the probability of the successful
%rate of a plan would be updated accordingly. The planner then use the updated information to 
%compute a new path.




%application: the key-room problem--> each room lock a key, one room has a treasure, the agent needs to go through 
%a maze to collect the keys for each door and get the treasure

%Stochastic Shortest-Path Problems
%A Stochastic Shortest-Path problem is an mdp prob-
%lem in which the state space S = f1; : : : ; n; tg is such
%that t is a goal (target) state that is absorbing (i.e.,
%p(t; u; t) = 1 and g(t; u) = 0 for all u 2 U(t)), and the
%discount factor ® = 1. In this case, the existence of
%optimal policies (and optimal stationary policies) is a
%major mathematical problem. However, the existence
%is guarantee under the following reasonable conditions:
%(A1) There exists a policy that achieves the goal with
%probability 1 from any starting state.
%(A2) All costs are positive.
%The ¯rst assumption just expresses the fact that the
%problem admits a well-behaved solution. Such policies
%are known as proper policies. The second assumption,
%in the other hand, guarantees that all improper policies
%incurs in in¯nite cost for at least one state. Thus, both
%assumptions preclude cases where the optimal solution
%might \wander" around without never getting to the
%goal. For example, a problem having a zero-cost cycle
%(in state space) violates the second assumption.
%As mentioned in the Introduction, often we are only
%interested in knowing how to go from a ¯xed initial
%state, say 1, to the goal state. The optimal solution in
%this case is an partial optimal stationary policy ¹ such
%that ¹(i) = ¹¤(i) for all states i that are reachable
%from 1 when using the optimal policy ¹¤; the so-called
%relevant states when starting from 1.1
%Finding a partial optimal policy can be consider-
%ably simpler, the extreme case when the set of relevant
%states is ¯nite and the complete state space is in¯nite.
%Thus, the question of how to ¯nd partial optimal poli-
%cies is of great relevance. One algorithm for that is
%Real-Time Dynamic Programming.
